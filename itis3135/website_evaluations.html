                <h3><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/">Best Buy</a></h3>
                <p>Best Buy is an electronic retail store that sells a wide variety of products including phones, TVs, Computers, and much more. </p>

                    <li>Repetition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In my assessment of Best Buy, I believe that they do a good job in following the CRAP principles for their website. 
                    The main use of colors for their brand, which are blue, black, white, and yellow, are repeatedly used to make the design of their website professional, 
                    and the allignment of their products and advertisements helps attract customer in navigating throughout the website.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
                <p>Craigslist is a website which offeres users to post any services, trades, or items to sell on their website. it consist a wide range of listings, from job posts to individual items that are listed for sale.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast</li>
                    <li>Repetition</li>
                    <li>Alignment</li>
                    <li>Proximity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Even though Craigslist is known to be very old, the simple design and layout as well as the lack of colors in their website can be hard for some users to read. 
                    The alignment of text in the website with the use of small text can be difficult for users to navigate through their desired listing.</p>
