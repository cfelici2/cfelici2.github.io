            <h2>How to plan a visit to Japan</h2>
            <div id="tabs">
                <h3>Find the best time to travel</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>It's exciting to take your first trip to another country, but before you book a flight right away you should first know the right time when you want to travel.
                        Travelling to Japan can be a unique experience even throughout the different seasons of the year, so make sure to plan what time of the year would you want to travel to Japan.
                        If you're travelling with others, make sure to find a time where all members of your party are available to travel together.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Make a list of activites in your trip</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Once you made sure of the time you'll be travelling to Japan, make a list of all the different activities and areas that you or your group would like to take up or explore.
                        Making a list ensures that you have a schedule to follow and be able to make the most of your trip there. 
                        Chek out the <a href="places.html" class="cherry_text">places</a> page to see some of the activities available in some areas.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Plan out your budget for the trip</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Before you head out to your trip to Japan, make sure you have a budget you can follow during your trip there.
                        You should make sure that while you're out there enjoying your trip that you have a limit in the amount of money you should spend in each area or district.
                        It can be tempting to spend a lot on your trip since you would want to make the most out of it, but a planned budget can help you with a good balance of money throughout each city or town you visit.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Get to know a little more about Japanese culture and language</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>Since you planned your trip to Japan, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to learn more about the country.
                        You should learn common greetings and how you can be respectful when you visit the country. 
                        During your stay, you'll be able to see the perspectives of different lifestyles within each town or city, and learning more about the country's culture can even develop a love for the country of Japan.
